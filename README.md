### Thank you for taking the time, feedback, and consideration for looking at my projects.###

## This interface is pretty straightforward and easy to navigate around ##

*** Disclosure, I wrote this project in Linux on Ubuntu so if there are any issues feel free to let me know and I will address them ***

# Lets Begin #

*** For accessing and running this project you first need to have Python and Flask and MySQL packages installed on your system. I installed mine via terminal in Ubuntu. ***

*** Once you save this project to you PC, you are going to want access it via command prompt or terminal my commands such as cd or change directory until you are in the myflaskapp folder. ***

### Once you are in the folder where the app.py file is, you are going to want to type python app.py and let command prompt or terminal execute that file ###

### Once that is successfull, you can access the website vial localhost:5000 ###

*** Once there, you should be on the main page with a welcome message and a little info on the project ***

*** You will notice the tabs in the top left, these are all functional. Use these tabs to go back to the home page, access the user register forms and order and scene request forms as well ***

### Unfortunately, the data doesnt display in the interface once you submit the forms, although you will be prompt with a message that the data was saved once the form is comlplete. ***

### You can access the db and tables via mysql commands and viewing the data that way ###

*** Thank you again for the time and consideration. I am open for any and all feedback on my code as I strive to improve daily on it ***
